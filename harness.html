<h2>Cable assembly and Wire harness</h2>
<img src="Images\Wire harness1.jpg">

<p>
The terms cable assembly and wire harness sounds similar but there is big difference between them.

The first difference begins with the terms wire and cable. A wire is a single or multiple stands of electric 
conductor. Those conductors are made of coppper, aluminum and steel.<br>
A cable is a group of wires with single or multile insulated wires wrapped in one jacket. Basically cables includes 3 wire
and they are positive wire, neutral wire and ground wire.<br><br>

How they uses?<br>
<ol>
  <li>Surrounding and enviornment<br>
<img src="E:\ALIAS FILES\PROJECTS\Web page\Blogs\Cable and wire harness\Images\rj451.jpg">
<ul>
<li>Wire <a href="">harness</a><!-- pop up as wikipedia about it --> fundamentally used for indoor purpose. Wires are not able to shield them from high temperature and 
friction between themselves. Thus wire harnesses provide lesser protection for the wires that used in the harness.</li>

<li>Cable assemblies protect all wires from extreme conditions and ideally used in outdoor applications. It is resistant to '
outside variables like moisture, cold, heat and dust.They guard wires from friction and corrosion.</li>
</ul>  
</li>
  <li>Application and purpose
<img src="E:\ALIAS FILES\PROJECTS\Web page\Blogs\Cable and wire harness\Images\datacab1.jpg">
      <ul>
           <li>
              Wire harnesses guard outside from the harm produced by the flow of electricity and gives straight forward understanding to technicians

           </li>

           <li>Cable assemblies gives addition benefit to protect wires or cable from wear, tear and harsh environment.
           </li>
      </ul>
  <li>Physical <br>
<img src="E:\ALIAS FILES\PROJECTS\Web page\Blogs\Cable and wire harness\Images\Coaxial2.jpg">
 <ul>
           <li>In Wire harness one can see and remove each wire (if there is multiple wires) from the harness</li>
<img src="E:\ALIAS FILES\PROJECTS\Web page\Blogs\Cable and wire harness\Images\panel.jpg">
  <li>In cable assemblies one cannnot see and remove a wire,since it is combined by outer jacket</li>
  </li>
</ul>

Products<br>

<ul>
<li>Most of our household products uses wire harness, examples like computers, televisions, monitors, microwaves, and refrigerators. 
It is also used in automobile and aircrafts</li>
 <img src="E:\ALIAS FILES\PROJECTS\Web page\Blogs\Cable and wire harness\Images\rj453.jpg">
<li>Cable assemblies are mostly used in medical, military, aerospace, construction and spaces where severe temperature change takes place.
they are good for high speed data transfer</li>
